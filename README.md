MagneticScaleSpeedometer

Experimental app - Scale speedometer using an Android phone and two magnets

This is an experimental app that uses the uses the phone's magnetometer sensor to calculate scale speed.

You just need:
* the app, and 
* two similar magnets stuck on a carriage or carriages at a fixed distance apart. 
 
The app reads the passing of the magnets and calculates the speed.

It is in a very early state at the moment and may yet prove impractical or unworkable.

Note that the magnets in the loco's motor are likely to trigger the sensor, so for the moment the carriage(s) with the magnets would need to be ahead or well back from the loco.  I'll work around that limitation later if the concept actually works.
